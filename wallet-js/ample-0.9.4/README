 About:
   Ample SDK is a standard-based cross-browser JavaScript GUI Framework
   for building client-side Rich Internet Applications. It employs XML
   technologies (such as XUL, SVG or HTML5) for UI layout, CSS for UI style
   and JavaScript with DOM3 or jQuery-like APIs for application logic.
   It equalizes browsers and brings technologies support to those missing any.

 Getting Started:
   The easiest way to get started is looking into examples folder and running
   its examples/index.html from your browser. You may also refer to the
   API Reference by accessing reference/index.html from your browser or online
